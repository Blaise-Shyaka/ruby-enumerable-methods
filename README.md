# Advanced Building Blocks: Ruby-Enumerable-methods

Welcome to our project "Advanced Building Blocks:Enumerable Methods". The purpose of this project was to develop our own implementation of some of the Enumerable methods such as:
- `each`
- `each_with_index`
- `map`
- `inject`
- `none?`
- `count`
- `all?`
- `any?`
- `select`.

## Built With

- Ruby
- Visual Studio Code
- Rubocop

### Setup

- You must have Ruby and Bundler (`gem install bundler`) installed (>=2.7.0).
- Then, clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/Blaise-Shyaka/ruby-enumerable-methods`.
- Then, go to the project folder (cd into it, if you are in an Unix-like Operating System).
- Install the dependencies by typing in `bundle install` in the command line.
- Run the project by typing in: `ruby enumerables.rb` in the command line.
- Note: There is a file called `tests.rb`. You should uncomment the lines related to the method that you want to test and then type `ruby tests.rb` to see the output of the tests for our methods.
